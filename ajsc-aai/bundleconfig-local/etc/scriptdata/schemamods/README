And to add a schemamod for a release, a file containing one or more schemaMod parameter lines is created.
If the directory for that release does not exist, add it

The doSchemaMods.sh script requires the release to be passed
as a parameter. It finds and applies schemamods under
the release folder matching the parameter.

This script is expected to be run for each installation.

e.g.

bundleconfig/etc/scriptdata/schemamods/v8/100-subscriber-name.txt

and 

100-subscriber-name.txt will have

subscriber-name String index true
